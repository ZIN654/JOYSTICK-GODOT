# Joystick in Godot: Static vs Dynamic

## Overview

In Godot, joysticks can be categorized into two types: **Static Joystick** and **Dynamic Joystick**. This document explains the difference between these two types of joysticks and how they can be used in a game project.

## Static Joystick

A **Static Joystick** is typically used for fixed control layouts, often seen in games with a fixed camera perspective or games that use a simple 2D interface. The joystick remains in a constant position on the screen or relative to a player‚Äôs input device, regardless of where the character or object moves.

### Characteristics:
- Fixed position.
- Typically used in mobile games.
- Does not move with the character or scene.
- Easier for beginner projects and games with simple controls.

### Example Usage:
In Godot, you can implement a static joystick using `Control` nodes that stay in a fixed position on the screen. You can set this up with `UI` elements such as `TextureRect` for background and `TextureButton` for the actual joystick.

## Dynamic Joystick

A **Dynamic Joystick** moves based on the player‚Äôs input or the camera's position. This joystick typically appears in more complex games with free movement, often used in 3D games where the joystick follows the player‚Äôs character or object as it moves through the world.

### Characteristics:
- Moves based on input.
- Often used for 3D games or open-world games.
- The position changes depending on the character's movement.
- Can be more immersive but requires more advanced setup.

### Example Usage:
To implement a dynamic joystick in Godot, you may need to use the `InputEvent` class to track the player's input and move the joystick accordingly. It often involves a combination of `Tween` nodes or manually adjusting the position of the joystick.

## Conclusion

- **Static Joystick**: Simple, fixed, ideal for 2D or mobile games.
- **Dynamic Joystick**: Responsive, changes position based on input, better suited for 3D or more advanced games.

Choose the type that best suits your game's design and control requirements.

you can tweak some exported properties there to switch between dynamic and static joystick. hope this helps. and go make a good enjoying gameüî•üëåüíØü§ç.
